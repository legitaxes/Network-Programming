# Network Programming 
[Jonkoping University](https://ju.se/en/study-at-ju/courses/programme-course/network-programming-autumn-2024-t4224.html)

Completed the course in Winter 2024

Contains code for the network programming lab exercises. 
There are some issues with the [regex](https://github.com/legitaxes/Network-Programming/blob/main/lab/lab10.py), [text encoding](https://github.com/legitaxes/Network-Programming/blob/main/lab/lab9.py) the [database](https://github.com/legitaxes/Network-Programming/blob/main/lab/lab11.py) lab as I've finished it on the first week of school where the requirement of the lab wasn't publicly announced.

If you do happen to steal the code from here, at least understand what the code is doing minimallyðŸ˜‰
